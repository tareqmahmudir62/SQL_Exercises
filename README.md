# SQL_Exercises
✍️ These are the collection of the solutions to the exercise questions which I had to solve to pass the SQL course from the UDACITY platform



## <b> Overview </b> ##
These questions were solved using the Parch & Posey database for my queries. Parch & Posey (not a real company) is a paper company and the database includes sales data for their paper. I have used their sales data, I was able to put my SQL skills to work with data I would find in the real world.
